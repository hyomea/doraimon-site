  <h2>"An AI with heart, inspired by a childhood friend."</h2>

  <p>
    At DorAImon Apps, we believe AI shouldnâ€™t replace you â€” it should <span class="highlight">stand beside</span> you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like Doraemon was to Nobita: a loyal companion, a trusted presence, a thoughtful nudge, a quiet kind of support that helps you <span class="highlight">try</span>, <span class="highlight">stumble</span>, and <span class="highlight">grow</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not every challenge needs a miracle gadget â€” sometimes, it just takes something that <span class="highlight">understands</span> you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thatâ€™s the relationship weâ€™re building between humans and AI: grounded in <span class="highlight">trust</span>, guided by <span class="highlight">privacy</span>, and shaped by <span class="highlight"> who you are </span>.
