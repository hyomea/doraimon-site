# Toastify Privacy Policy

_Last updated: May 10, 2025_

Toastify is committed to respecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the app.

---

## What Data We Collect

Toastify is designed to keep your data as private as possible.

- **Speech Transcripts**: When you use Free Talk or Topic Practice, your speech is transcribed on-device.
- **Feedback Requests**: If you request AI-powered feedback, only your transcribed text (not audio) is sent to our third-party language model API provider (OpenAI).

We do **not** collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email, or contacts.

---

## iCloud Sync

If you enable sync, your saved sessions, custom topics, and app settings are stored in your private iCloud account. This data is encrypted and not accessible by us. You can disable iCloud sync at any time in the app settings.

---

## Speech Feedback via OpenAI

To provide helpful feedback on expression and clarity, Toastify uses the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/) to process submitted text.

- Only the **text** you choose to submit is sent to OpenAI â€” **not** the original audio.
- The data is used **only to generate feedback** and is not stored by us.
- OpenAI does not retain or use your inputs for model training, per their [API data usage policy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy).

---

## Analytics and Crash Reporting

Toastify uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for crash diagnostics and basic usage insights:

- **Crashlytics** helps us fix bugs by collecting anonymized crash logs (device type, OS version, etc.).
- **Google Analytics for Firebase** tracks general app usage, like feature engagement and session length.

These services collect **anonymous** data and are used only to improve app stability and usability. We do not use this data for advertising or tracking.

---

## Your Control

- You choose whether to save or delete each session.
- You control whether sync are enabled.
- You can delete your app data at any time by clearing local storage or disabling iCloud.
